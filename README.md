## Keep in mind that you need your own cluster in mongoDB and your own MONGO_URI for the project to work (see .env file)

After installing the project use this command in the root folder to install all of the dependencies:
```npm install axios concurrently dotenv express express-session jsonwebtoken mongoose react-router-dom request && cd client && npm install cross-fetch react react-dom react-query react-router-dom react-scripts web-vitals @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event```
